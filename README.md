# ML-for-sustainability
Data-driven exploration and predictive modeling in the realm of sustainability. This collection of Jupyter notebooks is dedicated to harnessing the power of data analysis and machine learning to address crucial challenges in the field of energy sustainability.

**Diverse Datasets:** I use a rich assortment of datasets covering various aspects of energy, sourced from reputable repositories and organizations. Moreover, I dive into data related to renewable energy sources, energy consumption patterns, emissions, and more. 

**Data Preprocessing and Exploration:** I go through the preprocessing steps essential for extracting meaningful information from raw data. Also, I leverage exploratory data analysis techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the energy datasets before using them in the training phase.

**Machine Learning Models:** I apply cutting-edge machine learning algorithms to predict future energy trends and classify energy consumption patterns. So far, I have used K-nearest Neighbors Algorithm, Decision Trees, and Online Change-Point Detection.

**Visualizations and Interpretations:** I visualize complex data relationships and model outputs through interactive plots and graphs.
